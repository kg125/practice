Cover Sheet for Individual Coursework

Module Code: CO1003

Assignment:  Worksheet 3



Declaration of Academic Honesty

I understand that this is a piece of individual coursework. I confirm that:

* The solutions are my own work. I have not collaborated with other
  students or anyone else in coming up with the solutions.

* I have not discussed  any details of this solution to the coursework
  with other students or anyone else.  

  --   Discussions of general concepts related to the coursework are
       fine, but not any details relating to specific coursework
       questions.  For example - studying the notes or slides of
       lectures relating to the module together is acceptable, but
       talking about the homework questions is not.

* I have not shown any parts of my solution to other students or
  anyone else.

* I have not looked at the solutions written by any other students or
  by anyone else.

* I have appropriately cited any references (Internet, books, source
  code etc.) that I have used to produce my solutions or any parts of
  them.


The penalties for plagiarism are serious - the MSc and BSc course
Handbooks and the Department's "For Campus" site contain further
details. I am aware that any violation of the above would constitute
plagiarism and carry serious penalties.
